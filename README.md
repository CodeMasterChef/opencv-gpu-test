# opencv-gpu-test:

Sample code of testing functions of OpenCV with CUDA-enabled DNN modules.

# Setting up
```
$ cd yolos
$ wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
$ cd ..
```
# Run with Python benchmark:

```
cd python_code
```

Run with GPU:

```
python main.py -gpu=1
```

Run with CPU:

```
python main.py
```

# References:

Then go to either [Python](https://github.com/Cuda-Chen/opencv-dnn-cuda-test/tree/master/python_code)
 or [C++](https://github.com/Cuda-Chen/opencv-dnn-cuda-test/tree/master/cpp_code) part to validate the installation of OpenCV
with CUDA-enabled DNN modules.
